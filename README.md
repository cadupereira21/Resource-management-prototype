# Resource Management Prototype
This repository will be storing the unity project I'm using in the course Junior Programmer Pathway - Manage scene flow and data from Unity Learn.

BEFORE BEGINNING THE MISSION

In this mission from Unity Learn, I expect to learn more about scene management and flow, an important aspect of game development and design, which we use to define levels and the game flow. Likewise, I expect to learn more about data management in game development, like data persistence between scenes.

AFTER THE MISSION

After completing this mission, I've learned to implement data persistence between scenes and sessions. Likewise, I always exercized my knowledge on loading scenes asynchronously, with a loading screen using a slider as a progress bar!
