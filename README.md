# Resource Management Prototype
This repository will be storing the unity project I'm using in the course Junior Programmer Pathway - Manage scene flow and data from Unity Learn.

In this mission from Unity Learn, I expect to learn more about scene management and flow, an important aspect of game development and design, which we use to define levels and the game flow. Likewise, I expect to learn more about data management in game development, like data persistence between scenes.
